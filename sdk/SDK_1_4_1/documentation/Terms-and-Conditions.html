<p>of SynchronicIT B.V., hereinafter also ‘SynchronicIT’, established at
Spoorstraat 158, 6591 GW Gennep, the Netherlands. Registered with the
Dutch Chamber of Commerce as number 72543515.</p>
<p>The headings to the articles of these general terms are for the sole
purpose of increasing their readability. Accordingly, the content and

<h3 id="article-1-general">Article 1 GENERAL</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>These General Terms and Conditions (‘the Terms’) apply to all
SynchronicIT’s offers and contracts and form the basis of all deliveries
of goods and/or services by SynchronicIT, all in the most general
sense.</li>
<li>Any provisions and/or arrangements differing from these Terms shall
apply only if they have been expressly confirmed in writing by
SynchronicIT. Contrary terms put forward by the other party do not apply
to contracts entered into with SynchronicIT and are not binding on
SynchronicIT.</li>
<li>In these Terms, ‘other party’ means the buyer or any party who has
placed an order with SynchronicIT. Where these Terms refer to the other
party, the reference also applies to the latter’s agents,
representatives, heirs and other assigns. ‘Other party’ also includes a
potential other party.</li>
<li>In these Terms, ‘goods’ also refers to a single item of goods in
physical, non-physical (software / firmware) form and/or sevices.</li>
<li>In these Terms, ‘statutory interest’ means the statutory interest
referred to in articles 119a and 120 paragraph 2 of Book 6 of the
Netherlands Civil Code.</li>

<h3 id="article-2-quotations">Article 2 QUOTATIONS</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>All quotations are without obligation unless expressly stated
otherwise; details and enclosures provided are solely for information
and give only a general reproduction.</li>
<li>A quotation is valid for a period as stated in the quotation itself.
If no period is stated, the quotation is valid for a period of thirty
days.</li>
<li>SynchronicIT reserves the right to refuse orders.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="article-3-prices">Article 3 PRICES</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>The prices quoted by SynchronicIT are based on the price-determining
factors applicable at the time of the offer, such as prices of
materials, premiums, taxes, duties, freight charges, exchange rates
etc., including the wage bill calculated at SynchronicIT’s current
tariffs.</li>
<li>SynchronicIT is entitled to increase the agreed prices if there is a
change in one or more of the price-determining factors after the
finalisation of the contract.</li>
<li>In all cases, the prices shown in the quotation are exclusive of all
direct and indirect taxes, import and excise duties, and also exclusive
of transport and postage costs and insurance premiums. The said direct
and indirect taxes, import and excise duties, transport and postage
costs and insurance premiums are for the other party’s account and risk
at all times unless otherwise agreed in writing.</li>

</ol>
<h3 id="article-4-creation-of-a-contract">Article 4 CREATION OF A
CONTRACT</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>A contract between SynchronicIT and the other party is deemed only
to come into being if and insofar as SynchronicIT has provided a written
notice accepting the order placed by the other party and that notice has
been signed for approval by the other party and received back by
SynchronicIT .</li>
<li>Without prejudice to the provisions in the first paragraph, a
contract also comes into being through an electronic order placed in the
manner indicated on the SynchronicIT website, followed by a written
confirmation from SynchronicIT .</li>
<li>An order placed orally by the other party lapses if it is not
accepted immediately by SynchronicIT in a written notice of
acceptance.</li>
<li>Any additional agreements or changes to the contract are not binding
on SynchronicIT until they have been accepted in writing. Dutch Chamber
of Commerce 72543515</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="article-5-intellectual-property-and-third-party-rights">Article
5 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>The copyright and all other third-party intellectual or industrial
property rights in respect of goods supplied to the other party or made
available for the latter’s use by SynchronicIT , including the manuals,
descriptions and documentation relating to such goods, rest with
SynchronicIT or its licensor. The other party acquires only those rights
expressly granted to him by contract and/or in these Terms.</li>
<li>If any claim is made by one or more third parties in respect of
copyright and/or other intellectual or industrial property rights
existing in the Netherlands or there is a threat of such a claim,
SynchronicIT may immediately replace the goods forming the subject of
the infringement or alleged infringement and/or change them in such a
way as to avoid infringement. The other party is obliged to cooperate in
any such replacement and/or change.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="article-6-performance">Article 6 PERFORMANCE</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>An agreed period within which the contract is to be performed shall
not be a condition going to the root of the contract, unless expressly
agreed otherwise. In the event of late performance, the other party must
declare SynchronicIT to be in default in writing.</li>
<li>A delay of less than 30 days in complying with the delivery time
shall not under any circumstances, even after written notice of default,
give rise to any entitlement to compensation and/or any right to
dissolve the contract and/or any right for the other party to carry out
the contracted performance himself or have it carried out by third
parties, unless agreed otherwise in writing.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="article-7-delivery">Article 7 DELIVERY</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Goods are delivered ‘ex warehouse’ in all cases, unless agreed
otherwise in writing.</li>
<li>As soon as SynchronicIT has informed the other party that the goods
are ready for delivery from a particular date, the goods shall be deemed
to have been delivered effectively on that date. From that date on, the
goods remain on SynchronicIT ’s premises at the other party’s risk. If
the goods have not been collected within two weeks after the date of the
above notification, SynchronicIT shall be entitled to charge the other
party a custody charge in accordance with SynchronicIT ’s current
tariff.</li>
<li>The risk of damage to or destruction or loss of the goods to be
supplied passes to the other party immediately SynchronicIT has provided
the notification referred to in the preceding paragraph, even where the
goods are to be transported by SynchronicIT .</li>
<li>Where it has been agreed that the goods are to be transported by
SynchronicIT , the cheapest method of shipping will be adopted in all
cases unless agreed otherwise in writing. The goods travel for the other
party’s account and risk in all cases, unless agreed otherwise in
writing. Without prejudice to the provisions in article 8, SynchronicIT
is not liable for loss or damage resulting from any stoppage or delay in
transport unless caused by the fault or gross negligence of SynchronicIT
or its management. Article 8 NON-ATTRIBUTABLE SHORTCOMING IN PERFORMANCE
OF CONTRACT</li>
<li>It is a non-attributable shortcoming in SynchronicIT ’s performance
of the contract if after the finalisation of the contract SynchronicIT
is prevented from complying with its obligations under this contract or
with the preparations for it as a result of inter alia riots, war and
kindred risks, fire, water damage, flooding, strike, government
measures, faults in machinery or interruptions to power supplies, all as
affecting either SynchronicIT or third parties from whom SynchronicIT is
obliged to obtain the necessary documents, materials, raw goods or
personnel in whole or in part, and also during storage or transport
whether by or on behalf of SynchronicIT , and further as a result of all
other causes originating other than through SynchronicIT ’s fault or for
its risk.</li>
<li>In the event of non-attributable shortcomings as referred to in the
previous paragraph on the part of SynchronicIT , the latter’s delivery
obligations and other obligations shall be suspended unless SynchronicIT
still opts to meet its obligations as soon as is reasonably
possible.</li>
<li>If the performance of the contract is delayed for more than two
months as a result of non-attributable shortcoming in the performance of
the contract on the part of SynchronicIT , both SynchronicIT and the
other party shall have the right to invoke the dissolution of the
contract by a notification in writing. In the latter case, SynchronicIT
and the other party must agree arrangements for dealing with the
consequences relating to the contract. In that case, SynchronicIT will
be entitled at least to repayment of the costs incurred by it.</li>
<li>In the event that the contract is dissolved or suspended in
consequence of a non-attributable shortcoming, SynchronicIT shall not be
obliged to pay any damages.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="article-9-liability">Article 9 LIABILITY</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>All liabilities on the part of SynchronicIT that are not expressly
acknowledged in these Terms or in the contract, and in particular
liabilities for damages, whatever legal ground they may be based on, are
excluded insofar as legally permitted, also insofar as these liabilities
relate to the other party’s guarantee rights.</li>

and/or damage to items, machines, installations and buildings or for

by third parties as a result of incorrect delivery or of faults and
defects in the goods delivered and/or advice provided and/or services
performed by SynchronicIT . Further, SynchronicIT does not accept any
liability for loss resulting from the incorrect or improper use of the
goods supplied by SynchronicIT and/or from the incorrect or improper

is not liable if it is unable to comply with its obligations under the
contract as a result of a non-attributable shortcoming.</li>
<li>Without prejudice to the provisions in the preceding paragraphs,
SynchronicIT is also not liable for loss resulting from the fact that
the other party may not use the goods supplied by SynchronicIT owing to
the current law or regulations in the country where the other party
wishes to use the supplied goods.</li>
<li>The provisions in the third paragraph apply mutatis mutandis if the
other party sells the goods on or otherwise makes them available to one
or more third parties.</li>

compensation to be paid shall be no more than the amount received by

repairing the goods that were not delivered as contracted or the costs
of replacing the said goods, whichever may be lowest.</li>

is the result of deliberate acts or gross negligence by SynchronicIT or
its managerial staff.</li>

<li>If contrary to the provisions of article 7 SynchronicIT has
delivered the goods and the other party has not paid in full, the goods
shall continue to be for the other party’s risk and shall remain the
property of SynchronicIT for as long as the other party has not paid in

under the contract or the services performed or performable for the
other party under that contract and in respect of claims for any
shortcoming in the performance of the said contracts.</li>

inspection by SynchronicIT on first notification. If SynchronicIT so

the property law consequences of the reservation of title shall be
governed by the law of the destination state if that law contains

pursuant to article 19 and the good or goods sold are in fact imported
into the indicated destination state.</li>

SynchronicIT’s request furnished security to SynchronicIT’s satisfaction
for compliance with all his obligations under this contract. This
provision continues to apply if credit has been stipulated.</li>
<li>Where the period set by SynchronicIT for furnishing security has
lapsed or where the other party refuses to furnish security, the other
party shall be in default by operation of law and SynchronicIT may then
dissolve the contract without the intervention of the courts by a
